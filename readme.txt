Inject an array of posts into a WP query object as if queried, particularly useful to allow use of standard template tags.


== Description ==

WordPress's template tags are intended to be used within 'the loop'. The loop is managed by a WP_Query object which sets up various global variables and its own object variables for use by the various template tags. The primary purpose of a WP_Query object is to actually query the database for the posts that match the currently specified criteria. However, if you don't need to query for posts since you already have them by some other means, you can still take advantage of the template tags by injecting those posts into the WP_Query via this plugin.

Depending on the template tags you are looking to use, or the logic you are hoping to employ within a loop, you may need to manually configure some of the query object's variables.

Example:

`
<?php // Say we're in the sidebar

// We've gotten some post objects on our own.
$posts = c2c_get_random_posts( 5, '' );

// Inject the posts
c2c_inject_query_posts( $posts );

// Now let's display them via template tags:
if ( have_posts() ) :
    while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>

        <li><a href="<?php the_permalink() ?>" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to <?php the_title_attribute(); ?>"><?php the_title(); ?></a></li>

    <?php endwhile;?>
<?php endif; ?>

== Installation ==

1. Unzip `inject-query-posts.zip` inside the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory for your site (or install via the built-in WordPress plugin installer)
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' admin menu in WordPress
1. Use the `c2c_inject_query_posts()` function to inject an array of posts into a WP query object.  Specify the posts array as the first argument.  Configure the query object by passing an array as the second argument.  If specifying a WP query object, pass it as the third object; if not specified then the global wp_query object will be assumed.


== Template Tags ==

The plugin provides one template tag for use in your theme templates, functions.php, or plugins.

= Functions =

* `<?php function c2c_inject_query_posts( $posts, $config = array(), $query_obj = null, $preserve_query_obj = true, $cache_posts = true ) ?>`
Injects an array of posts into a query object as if that query object had obtained those posts via a query.

= Arguments =

* `$posts` (array)
Array of posts to inject into the query object.

* `$config` (array)
Optional.  Associative array of query object variables to directly set, and their values.

* `$query_obj` (WP_Query|null)
Optional.  The query object to modify. If null, then the global wp_query object will be used. Pass a string or non-zero integer to have a new query object created and used.

* `$preserve_query_obj` (bool)
Optional.  Should the query object be kept as-is prior to injecting posts? Default is false. If false, then the object is re-initialized/reset before post injection.

* `$cache_posts` (bool)
Optional.  Update the posts in cache? Default is true.

= Examples =

* (See Description section for an additional example.)

* Similar to previous example, for WP 3.0+

`
<?php
$posts = c2c_get_random_posts( 5, '' ); // Obtain posts via your favorite related posts, find posts, etc plugin, or via custom query
do_action( 'c2c_inject_query_posts', $posts ); // Better than direct call to c2c_inject_query_posts( $posts );
get_template_part( 'loop' );
?>
`

== Filters ==

The plugin is further customizable via two hooks. Typically, these customizations would be put into your active theme's functions.php file, or used by another plugin.

= inject_query_posts_preserve_query_obj (filter) =

The 'inject_query_posts_preserve_query_obj' filter allows you override the value of the `$preserve_query_obj` argument passed to the function. This is not typical usage for most users.

Arguments:

* $preserve_query_obj (bool) : Boolean indicating if the query object was set to be preserved or not
* $query_obj (WP_Query object) : The WP_Query object passed to the `c2c_inject_query_posts()`
* $posts (array) : The posts being injected into the WP_Query object
* $config (array) : Query object variables to directly set, and their values.

Example:

`
// Always preserve the condition of the WP_Query object
add_filter( 'inject_query_posts_preserve_query_obj', 'my_preserve_query_obj', 10, 4 );
function my_preserve_query_obj( $preserve_query_obj, $query_obj, $posts, $config ) {
	return true;
}
`

= c2c_inject_query_posts (action) =

The 'c2c_inject_query_posts' filter allows you to use an alternative approach to safely invoke `c2c_inject_query_posts()` in such a way that if the plugin were deactivated or deleted, then your calls to the function won't cause errors in your site.

Arguments:

* The same arguments as `c2c_inject_query_posts()`

Example:

Instead of:

`<?php echo c2c_inject_query_posts( $posts, array( 'is_search' => true ) ); ?>`

Do:

`<?php echo do_action( 'c2c_inject_query_posts', $posts, array( 'is_search' => true ) ); ?>`
