/**
 * Plugin Name: Inject Query Posts
 * Version:     2.2.1
 * Plugin URI:  http://coffee2code.com/wp-plugins/inject-query-posts/
 * Author:      Scott Reilly
 * Author URI:  http://coffee2code.com/
 * License:     GPLv2 or later
 * License URI: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
 * Description: Inject an array of posts into a WP query object as if queried, particularly useful to allow use of standard template tags.
 *
 * Compatible with WordPress 3.6 through 4.0+.
 *
 * NOTE: Injecting posts into a query object will cause that object to forget about previous posts it may have retrieved. You probably
 * only want to do this outside of any existing loops, and create your own custom loop after the injection.
 *
 * =>> Read the accompanying readme.txt file for instructions and documentation.
 * =>> Also, visit the plugin's homepage for additional information and updates.
 * =>> Or visit: https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/inject-query-posts/
 *
 * TODO: (in 3.0)
 * 	* Rename $preserve_query_obj arg to $reset_query_obj. Leave default as true, which changes default behavior of the arg.
 * 	* Deprecate 'inject_query_posts_preserve_query_obj' filter and introduce 'c2c_inject_query_posts_reset_query_obj'
 * 	* Remove already deprecated inject_query_posts()
 *
 * @package Inject_Query_Posts

 * @version 2.2.1

 * Injects an array of posts into a query object as if that query object had
 * obtained those posts via a query.
 *
 * NOTE: If you wish to fully simulate a query despite the fact that the query
 * object is not performing the actual database query, you must specify the
 * a query via $config (i.e. array('query'=>'cat=5')) and/or directly set
 * query object variables via $config.
 *
 * NOTE: By default, the function assumes the posts being injected will
 * invalidate any existing state in the query object, so that query object will
 * be reset prior to post inject.  Set $preserve_query_obj to true to retain
 * the state of the query object.
 *
 * NOTE: In order for 'query' to be configured via $config, $preserve_query_obj
 * must be false.
 *
 * @param array $posts Array of posts to inject into the query object.
 * @param array $config (optional) Associative array of query object variables to directly set, and their values.
 * @param WP_Query|null $query_obj (optional) The query object to modify. If null, then the global wp_query object will be used. Pass a string or non-zero integer to have a new query object created and used.
 * @param bool $preserve_query_obj (optional) Should the query object be kept as-is prior to injecting posts? Default is true. If false, then the object is re-initialized/reset.
 * @param bool $cache_posts (optional) Update the posts in cache? Default is true.
 * @return array The originally passed in array of posts.
